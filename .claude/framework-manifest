# Clyde Framework Manifest
# Lists all framework-owned paths for the /update skill.
#
# D <dir>  — directory-replace: delete stale files, sync all from upstream
# F <file> — individual file: replace with upstream version
#
# Paths NOT listed here are project-owned and never touched by /update.
# __pycache__/ directories are always excluded from directory syncs.
