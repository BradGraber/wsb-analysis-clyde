# Task: Build reusable EmptyState component and configure all empty state messages

## Description
Create a reusable `<EmptyState :message="msg" :icon="icon" />` component and configure all empty state messages: Signals tab ("No analysis runs yet", "No signals for this type"), Positions tab ("No open positions"), Performance tab ("No evaluation periods", "Active period: Day N of 30", "No positions in period"). Integrate into the Signals, Positions, and Performance views.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Reusable `<EmptyState>` component accepts message and optional icon props
- [ ] Signals empty states: "No analysis runs yet" (no runs), "No signals for this type" (run exists but no signals)
- [ ] Positions empty state: "No open positions"
- [ ] Performance empty states: "No evaluation periods", "Active period: Day N of 30", "No positions in period"
- [ ] Each view renders the appropriate empty state when data is absent

## Technical Notes
- EmptyState component: centered text with optional icon, consistent styling
- Determine which empty state to show based on composable data: empty array vs null vs special conditions
- Performance "Active period: Day N of 30" is a partial empty state (period exists but no closures yet)
- UI-EMPTY-STATES requirement

## Dependencies
- Depends on: task-008-002-01 (sub-tab views exist to place empty states)
- Blocks: none
