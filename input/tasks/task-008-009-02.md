# Task: Implement results summary overlay and warnings display

## Description
On pipeline completion (status='completed'), display a results summary overlay showing: signals_created, positions_opened, exits_triggered, errors count. Implement the tiered warnings display: 0 warnings omits the section, 1-3 show as inline bulleted list, 4+ show first 3 with expandable "and N more..." toggle. Warnings include type prefix labels.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] On completion, results summary overlay appears with: signals_created, positions_opened, exits_triggered, errors
- [ ] 0 warnings: section omitted entirely
- [ ] 1-3 warnings: inline bulleted list with type prefix labels
- [ ] 4+ warnings: first 3 shown, "and N more..." expandable toggle reveals the rest
- [ ] Warning type prefix label displayed (e.g., "Schwab Stock Unavailable: AAPL")
- [ ] Overlay is dismissible (close button or click-away)

## Technical Notes
- Results fields from completed run response (from useAnalysis composable)
- Warnings deserialized from analysis_runs.warnings JSON field
- Expandable "and N more": use `<b-collapse>` or v-show toggle
- Results overlay: could be a modal, toast, or inline card at top of dashboard
- Warning type prefix comes from the warning object's type field

## Dependencies
- Depends on: task-008-009-01 (progress indicator provides the completion trigger)
- Blocks: none
