# Task: Build evidence drill-down modal with signal header and comment layout

## Description
Create the evidence drill-down modal that opens on signal card click. Display a signal header (ticker, direction, confidence, signal type, date) and a two-column layout for comments: original comment text on the left and AI annotations on the right (sentiment badge, sarcasm flag, reasoning indicator, confidence score, author trust score). Use bootstrap-vue-next `<b-modal>`. Modal closes via close button, Escape, or clicking outside.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Clicking a signal card opens a `<b-modal>` overlay
- [ ] Modal header shows: ticker, direction, overall confidence, signal type, date
- [ ] Each comment displays original text alongside AI annotations (sentiment, sarcasm, reasoning, confidence, author trust)
- [ ] Author trust score displayed per comment
- [ ] FR-007: Original comment text is always visible (not behind a toggle)
- [ ] Modal closes via close button, Escape key, or clicking outside

## Technical Notes
- GET /signals/{id}/comments returns paginated comments with AI annotations
- Comment fields: comment text, author name, author_trust_score, sentiment, sarcasm_flag, reasoning_text, ai_confidence
- Two-column layout: comment left, annotations right (stacks vertically on narrow viewports if needed)
- Sentiment badge: bullish (green), bearish (red), neutral (gray)
- Sarcasm flag: visual indicator when true (e.g., "/s" badge or icon)
- Use bootstrap-vue-next `<b-modal>` with size="xl" for wide layout

## Dependencies
- Depends on: task-008-003-01 (signal card is the click target)
- Blocks: task-008-006-02, task-008-015-01
