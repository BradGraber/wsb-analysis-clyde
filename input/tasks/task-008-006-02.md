# Task: Add comment pagination and reasoning summary expand/collapse

## Description
Implement pagination for comments in the evidence modal: initial load shows the first page, with a "Load More" button that fetches additional pages via GET /signals/{id}/comments with offset. Add the "Show Reasoning Summary" expand/collapse toggle that reveals the AI reasoning summary text (a signal-level field, not per-comment).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Initial load displays first page of comments (limit=20)
- [ ] "Load More" button visible when additional pages exist, fetches next page via offset pagination
- [ ] Comments append to existing list (not replace)
- [ ] "Show Reasoning Summary" toggle expands/collapses the AI reasoning summary text
- [ ] Reasoning summary is a signal-level field displayed once at the top, not per-comment

## Technical Notes
- Pagination: use offset-based pattern matching API standard (limit=20, offset increments by 20)
- Disable "Load More" when all comments are loaded (response count < limit)
- Reasoning summary: from signal object's reasoning_summary field
- Expand/collapse: use bootstrap-vue-next `<b-collapse>` or simple v-if toggle

## Dependencies
- Depends on: task-008-006-01 (modal structure and comment layout)
- Blocks: none
