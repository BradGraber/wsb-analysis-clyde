# Task: Build SignalCard component with two-row layout and confidence ordering

## Description
Create the `<SignalCard>` Vue component with the two-row layout. Row 1: ticker symbol, direction arrow (up=bullish, down=bearish), confidence badge (0-100), comment count, signal type pill (blue=Quality, purple=Consensus). Row 2: age label (relative time from signal_date), emergence flag ("Activates in N days" or "Active"), and sparkline placeholder slots. Signals list is ordered by composite confidence descending.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `<SignalCard :signal="signal" :portfolio-id="portfolioId" />` renders the two-row layout
- [ ] Row 1 displays: ticker, direction arrow, confidence badge, comment count, signal type pill with correct color
- [ ] Row 2 displays: age label (relative time), emergence flag, and sparkline placeholder areas
- [ ] Signal list is sorted by composite confidence descending within the active portfolio (FR-004)
- [ ] Age label computes client-side from signal_date UTC (e.g., "2 hours ago", "3 days ago")
- [ ] Emergence: Days 1-7 yellow "Activates in N days", Day 8+ green "Active" (UI-EMERGENCE)

## Technical Notes
- Direction arrow: Bootstrap icons or unicode arrows (up-arrow for bullish, down-arrow for bearish)
- Confidence badge: numeric display with color scale (e.g., green >=70, yellow 50-69, red <50)
- Age label: use dayjs relativeTime or simple custom utility
- Emergence calculation: compare current date to signal_date + 7 days
- Sparkline placeholders: empty containers with defined dimensions (~100px x 30px) for story-008-005 to populate
- Component receives signal object with position_summary from GET /signals?portfolio_id=X

## Dependencies
- Depends on: task-008-002-01 (Signals sub-tab view), task-008-002-02 (useSignals composable)
- Blocks: task-008-003-02, task-008-005-01, task-008-006-01
