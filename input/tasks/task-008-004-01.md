# Task: Evaluate sparkline rendering approaches and produce recommendation

## Description
Time-boxed spike (1 day max) to evaluate at least 3 sparkline rendering approaches for the ~100px x 30px dual sparkline requirement: Chart.js/vue-chartjs, vue-sparklines (or equivalent Vue 3 library), and inline SVG generation. Prototype each at target size with 5-14 data points. Assess rendering quality, bundle size, adaptive rendering (dots for <=2 points, line for 3+), and Vue 3 Composition API compatibility. Produce recommendation document.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] At least 3 approaches prototyped at ~100px x 30px with sample data
- [ ] Evaluation covers: rendering quality, bundle size impact, adaptive rendering, Vue 3 compatibility
- [ ] Each prototype demonstrates both confidence sparkline and price sparkline
- [ ] Recommendation document produced at `working/plan/spikes/sparkline-evaluation.md`
- [ ] Document includes comparison table and final recommendation with rationale

## Technical Notes
- Chart.js: heavyweight but feature-rich; check for `chartjs-chart-sparkline` plugin
- vue-sparklines: verify Vue 3 support before investing time
- Inline SVG: lightest weight but needs manual line interpolation and dot rendering
- Also consider: unovis, lightweight D3-based sparklines, canvas-based approaches
- Adaptive rendering is a hard requirement: <=2 points -> dots, 3+ -> line
- Time-box strictly to 1 day; if no clear winner, recommend inline SVG as safest option

## Dependencies
- Depends on: task-008-001-01 (Vue scaffold to prototype within)
- Blocks: task-008-005-01 (sparkline implementation depends on recommendation)
