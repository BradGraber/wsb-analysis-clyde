# Task: Create API client module and establish fetch/Axios pattern

## Description
Create the `src/api/client.js` module that all subsequent stories use for API calls. Choose Axios or native fetch (per FR-012 / UI-TECH-STACK) and configure base URL, default headers, and a global timeout (API-TIMEOUT). Export typed helper functions for GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE. This pattern is established once and reused by every composable.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `src/api/client.js` exports `apiGet`, `apiPost`, `apiPatch`, `apiDelete` helper functions
- [ ] Base URL is derived from Vite proxy (`/api`)
- [ ] Default timeout is configured (e.g., 30 seconds)
- [ ] Error responses throw with status code and message for downstream handling
- [ ] A simple integration smoke test confirms the client can reach the proxied backend (or fails gracefully)

## Technical Notes
- Keep thin: this is a utility wrapper, not a state manager
- Downstream composables (useSignals, usePositions, etc.) import from this module
- Consider Axios interceptors or fetch wrapper for uniform error handling
- JSON content-type header by default

## Dependencies
- Depends on: task-008-001-01 (project scaffold with Vite proxy)
- Blocks: task-008-002-01 (composables use this client)
