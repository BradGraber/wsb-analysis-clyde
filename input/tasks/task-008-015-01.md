# Task: Build prediction tracking table with author filtering

## Description
Create a prediction tracking view accessible from the evidence drill-down modal (e.g., "View Author Predictions" button). Display a table of predictions filtered by author showing: ticker, option_type (Call/Put), strike, entry_premium, current_premium (or "N/A"), status badge (tracking/exited/expired), exit_reason, and is_correct (Correct=green, Incorrect=red, Pending/Excluded=gray). Fetch data via GET /predictions?author=X.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Prediction view accessible from evidence modal via "View Author Predictions" button/link
- [ ] Table columns: ticker, option_type, strike, entry_premium, current_premium, status, exit_reason, is_correct
- [ ] Filtered by author (pre-populated from evidence modal context)
- [ ] Status badges: "tracking" (blue), "exited" (gray), "expired" (yellow)
- [ ] is_correct display: true->"Correct" (green), false->"Incorrect" (red), null->"Pending" or "Excluded" (gray)
- [ ] current_premium shows "N/A" or "--" when null

## Technical Notes
- GET /predictions?author=X from story-007-009
- Could be a nested modal, slide-out panel, or sub-view within evidence modal
- Consider `usePredictions(author)` composable for data fetching
- Author is passed from the evidence modal context (which comment/author was clicked)
- Table can use bootstrap-vue-next `<b-table>` for sorting and formatting

## Dependencies
- Depends on: task-008-006-01 (evidence modal provides access point), story-007-009 (prediction API endpoints)
- Blocks: task-008-015-02 (HITL override adds to this table)
