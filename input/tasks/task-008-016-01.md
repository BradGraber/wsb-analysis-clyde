# Task: Build performance sub-tab with evaluation period table and summary card

## Description
Implement the Performance sub-tab content view. Fetch evaluation periods via GET /evaluation-periods?portfolio_id=X and display in reverse chronological order. Each period shows: period_start, period_end, portfolio_return_pct, sp500_return_pct, relative_performance, beat_benchmark (green checkmark or red X), total_positions_closed, winning/losing positions, avg_return_pct, signal_accuracy_pct. Active periods distinguished with "In Progress" badge. Render empty state when no periods exist. Consider a summary card at top with aggregate stats.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Evaluation periods fetched via GET /evaluation-periods?portfolio_id=X
- [ ] Each period shows: period dates, portfolio_return_pct, sp500_return_pct, relative_performance, beat_benchmark
- [ ] Position metrics per period: total_positions_closed, winning, losing, avg_return_pct, signal_accuracy_pct
- [ ] Active period: "In Progress" badge, visually distinguished from completed periods
- [ ] beat_benchmark: green checkmark (true), red X (false), "N/A" (null)
- [ ] Periods in reverse chronological order (most recent first)
- [ ] Empty state when no evaluation periods exist

## Technical Notes
- GET /evaluation-periods requires portfolio_id as mandatory filter (story-007-003)
- NULL values for sp500_return_pct / relative_performance when yfinance data unavailable
- relative_performance = portfolio_return_pct - sp500_return_pct (pre-computed in API)
- Consider bootstrap-vue-next `<b-table>` for the period list or card-based layout
- Summary card at top: aggregate across all completed periods (optional enhancement)
- FR-018: benchmark comparison, UI-PERFORMANCE requirement

## Dependencies
- Depends on: task-008-002-01 (Performance sub-tab routing)
- Blocks: none
