# Task: Implement options time stop exit condition

## Description
Implement the options time stop exit condition function. When hold_days >= 10 calendar days from position open_date, trigger a full close (100% of contracts_remaining) with exit_reason='time_stop' and exit_price=current_premium. This is the lowest-priority options exit condition. Unlike stocks, options have a single fixed 10-day time stop with no tier extensions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Triggers when hold_days >= 10 calendar days
- [ ] Exits 100% of contracts_remaining (full close)
- [ ] Exit reason is 'time_stop'
- [ ] Exit price is current_premium
- [ ] Evaluated LAST in options exit cascade (lowest priority, PIPE-045)
- [ ] hold_days = (current_date - open_date).days using calendar days
- [ ] Function accepts MonitoredInstrument (not concrete Position type)

## Technical Notes
- FR-045: Exit 100% after 10 calendar days hold
- PIPE-045: Time stop is lowest priority in options cascade
- Full close invokes finalization (story-006-011)
- Simpler than stock time stop: single tier, no extensions

## Dependencies
- Depends on: task-006-005-01 (options exit cascade framework)
- Blocks: none
