title: Seed four portfolio records with $100k starting capital each
complexity: 1

# Task: Seed four portfolio records with $100k starting capital each

## Description
Add INSERT OR IGNORE statements for the 4 portfolio rows to the seed script. Each portfolio has starting_capital=100000, current_value=100000, cash_available=100000. The four portfolios are the cross-product of instrument_type (stock, option) and signal_type (quality, consensus). Ensure the name column has a UNIQUE constraint in the schema (or use INSERT OR IGNORE on name) for idempotent execution.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Four rows inserted: stocks_quality (stock/quality), stocks_consensus (stock/consensus), options_quality (option/quality), options_consensus (option/consensus)
- [ ] Each has starting_capital=100000, current_value=100000, cash_available=100000
- [ ] instrument_type uses 'stock' or 'option' (singular, not plural)
- [ ] signal_type uses 'quality' or 'consensus'
- [ ] Re-running does not create duplicates (INSERT OR IGNORE)
- [ ] SELECT COUNT(*) FROM portfolios returns exactly 4 after execution

## Technical Notes
- PRD Appendix B lines 1884-1889 contain the exact INSERT SQL
- portfolios.name should have a UNIQUE constraint in the schema (verify in task-001-001-01)
- created_at defaults to DATETIME('now')
- This is a very small task; consider combining with the seed script from task-001-002-01 into a single seed.sql file

## Files to Create/Modify
- `seed.sql` (append portfolio seed data)
