# Task: Create seed script with all 34 system_config entries using INSERT OR IGNORE

## Description
Create `seed.sql` (or append to `schema.sql`) containing INSERT OR IGNORE statements for all 34 system_config entries across 7 configuration groups. Each entry must use the exact key name and default value from PRD Section 3.3.4 and Appendix B. The 34th key (signal_min_confidence=0.50) is not in the PRD SQL but was added during Phase 4 remediation for qualified signal filtering. All entries set updated_at to DATETIME('now').

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 2 system state entries: system_start_date = DATE('now'), phase = 'paper_trading'
- [ ] 5 signal threshold entries with exact values: quality_min_users=2, quality_min_confidence=0.6, consensus_min_comments=30, consensus_min_users=8, consensus_min_alignment=0.7
- [ ] 4 confidence weight entries summing to 1.0: volume=0.25, alignment=0.25, ai_confidence=0.30, author_trust=0.20
- [ ] 6 author trust entries: quality=0.40, accuracy=0.50, tenure=0.10, default_accuracy=0.50, tenure_saturation_days=30, accuracy_ema_weight=0.30
- [ ] 10 stock exit entries matching PRD exactly (stop_loss=-0.10 through take_profit_exit_pct=0.50)
- [ ] 6 options exit entries matching PRD exactly (stop_loss=-0.50 through take_profit_exit_pct=0.50)
- [ ] 1 position management entry: signal_min_confidence=0.50
- [ ] All use INSERT OR IGNORE for idempotent execution
- [ ] Re-running the script produces no errors and no duplicate rows

## Technical Notes
- PRD Appendix B lines 1842-1882 contain the exact INSERT SQL for the first 33 keys
- The 34th key (signal_min_confidence) was added during Phase 4 remediation (story-005-002, PIPE-032)
- Use INSERT OR IGNORE INTO system_config (key, value, updated_at) VALUES (...) for each entry
- Consider grouping entries with SQL comments for each of the 7 groups for readability

## Files to Create/Modify
- `seed.sql` (new file, or appended section in schema.sql)
