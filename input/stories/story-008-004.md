# Story: Execute Sparkline Library Spike

## Description
Conduct a time-boxed (2-point) spike to evaluate sparkline rendering options for the dual sparkline requirement. Evaluate Chart.js (with vue-chartjs wrapper), vue-sparklines, inline SVG generation, and any other viable options. Produce a recommendation document with benchmarks, bundle size impact, and rendering quality assessment at the required ~100px x 30px size.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] At least 3 sparkline approaches are evaluated: Chart.js/vue-chartjs, vue-sparklines (or equivalent Vue 3 library), and inline SVG
- [ ] Each approach is prototyped at the target size (~100px x 30px) with sample data (5-14 data points)
- [ ] Evaluation covers: rendering quality at small size, bundle size impact, adaptive rendering support (dots for <=2 points, line for 3+), and ease of integration with Vue 3 Composition API
- [ ] A recommendation document is produced at `working/plan/spikes/sparkline-evaluation.md` with comparison table and final recommendation
- [ ] Recommended approach demonstrates both confidence sparkline and price sparkline rendering

## Technical Notes
- Time-box: 1 day maximum (2 story points)
- Key requirements from UI-SPARKLINES: ~100px x 30px each, adaptive rendering (<=2 points: scatter dots, 3+ points: line), placeholder while loading
- Chart.js is heavyweight but feature-rich; consider if `chartjs-chart-sparkline` plugin exists
- vue-sparklines may not have Vue 3 support; verify compatibility
- Inline SVG is lightest but requires manual implementation of line interpolation and dot rendering
- Consider also: unovis, lightweight D3-based sparklines, or canvas-based approaches
- The spike outcome feeds directly into story-008-005 implementation decisions

## Dependencies
- Depends on: story-008-001 (Vue scaffold to prototype within)
- Blocks: story-008-005 (sparkline implementation uses the recommended library)
