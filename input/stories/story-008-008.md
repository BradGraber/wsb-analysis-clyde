# Story: Implement Options Position Display

## Description
Extend the position list component to render options-specific fields for positions in Options/Quality and Options/Consensus portfolio tabs. Display DTE countdown, contracts and contracts_remaining, premium_change_pct, strike price, and option_type (Call/Put).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Options positions display DTE (days to expiration) as a countdown number with label (e.g., "14 DTE")
- [ ] DTE uses color coding: green (>14 days), yellow (7-14 days), red (<7 days)
- [ ] Contracts display shows contracts_remaining / contracts_total (e.g., "3/5 contracts")
- [ ] Premium change percentage is displayed with color: green for positive, red for negative
- [ ] Strike price and option_type are displayed as a combined label (e.g., "$150 Call" or "$140 Put")
- [ ] Options-specific fields are only rendered for positions where instrument_type='option' (stock positions show stock-specific layout)

## Technical Notes
- DTE is a convenience field computed by the API from the position's expiration_date
- premium_change_pct = (current_premium - entry_premium) / entry_premium * 100
- Option positions appear in Options/Quality (portfolio_id=3) and Options/Consensus (portfolio_id=4) tabs
- The position card component should conditionally render stock vs. options layout based on instrument_type
- Consider a sub-component pattern: `<StockPositionDetails>` and `<OptionsPositionDetails>` rendered inside `<PositionCard>`
- DTE countdown: compute from expiration_date field on the position object, or use dte convenience field from API

## Dependencies
- Depends on: story-008-007 (base position list and monitoring indicators)
- Blocks: none
