# Story: Create Seed Test Data Script

## Description
Create a Python script that populates the database with realistic mock data for frontend development. The seed data enables the Vue dashboard team to begin building against real GET endpoint responses without waiting for the full pipeline. Includes sample signals, positions (both open and closed), portfolio balances, evaluation periods, and analysis runs with varied statuses.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Script creates at least 2 completed analysis runs with realistic timestamps and varied statuses (completed, failed)
- [ ] Script populates all 4 portfolios with initial cash balances ($100,000 each per PRD and story-001-003)
- [ ] Script creates at least 10 signals across multiple tickers with varied signal_types (quality, consensus), confidence scores, and signal_dates
- [ ] Script creates at least 8 positions: mix of open and closed, stock and options, across multiple portfolios, with realistic entry prices and quantities
- [ ] Script creates position_exits records for closed positions with varied exit_reasons covering at least 4 of the 8 exit reason types
- [ ] Script creates at least 1 evaluation period per portfolio (mix of active and completed)
- [ ] Script is idempotent: running twice does not create duplicate records (uses INSERT OR IGNORE or checks for existing data)

## Technical Notes
- Script should be runnable standalone: `python scripts/seed_data.py`
- Use realistic WSB-style tickers (AAPL, GME, TSLA, NVDA, AMD, etc.)
- Include comments and signal_comments junction records so evidence drill-down works
- Include author records with varied trust_score values
- Include price_history records so sparklines have data to render
- Set one analysis run to status='running' so frontend can test the "analysis in progress" UI state (optional, can be toggled)
- Data should be internally consistent: positions reference valid signals, signals reference valid analysis_runs, etc.

## Dependencies
- Depends on: story-007-003 (endpoints must exist to verify seed data renders correctly)
- Blocks: none (but enables epic-008 frontend development)
