# Story: Implement Options Time Stop

## Description
Implement the time-based exit condition for options positions: exit 100% of contracts_remaining after 10 calendar days of holding. This is the lowest-priority options exit condition, checked only after expiration, stop-loss, take-profit, and trailing stop have all been evaluated.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Time stop triggers when hold_days >= 10 calendar days from position open_date
- [ ] Exits 100% of contracts_remaining (full close)
- [ ] Exit reason is set to 'time_stop'
- [ ] Exit price is set to current_premium at time of exit
- [ ] This condition is evaluated LAST in the options exit priority cascade (lowest priority per PIPE-045)
- [ ] hold_days uses calendar days, not trading days

## Technical Notes
- FR-045: Exit 100% after 10 calendar days hold.
- PIPE-045: Options priority order places time stop last (expiration > stop-loss > take-profit > trailing > time).
- This is a full close that will invoke full close finalization (story-006-011).
- Unlike stock time stops which have three tiers (base/extended/trailing), options have a single fixed 10-day time stop.
- hold_days = (current_date - open_date).days

## Dependencies
- Depends on: story-006-005 (expiration protection framework, options exit cascade structure)
- Blocks: none
