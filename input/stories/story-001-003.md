# Story: Initialize Portfolio Records with Four Portfolios at $100k Each

## Description
Seed the portfolios table with 4 rows representing the system's paper trading portfolios. Each portfolio has $100,000 starting capital, and the four portfolios cover the cross-product of instrument type (stock, option) and signal type (quality, consensus). This portfolio structure is fundamental to the position management and exit strategy pipelines.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Four portfolio rows are inserted: stocks_quality (stock/quality), stocks_consensus (stock/consensus), options_quality (option/quality), options_consensus (option/consensus)
- [ ] Each portfolio has starting_capital = 100000, current_value = 100000, cash_available = 100000
- [ ] The instrument_type column values are exactly 'stock' or 'option' (not 'stocks' or 'options')
- [ ] The signal_type column values are exactly 'quality' or 'consensus'
- [ ] Portfolio seed script is idempotent (re-running does not create duplicate portfolios)
- [ ] After seeding, `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM portfolios` returns exactly 4

## Technical Notes
- Exact INSERT SQL is provided in PRD Appendix B (lines 1884-1889)
- The seed script should use `INSERT OR IGNORE` with a UNIQUE constraint on the name column, or check for existing records
- The portfolios table has a created_at TIMESTAMP column that should default to DATETIME('now')
- This is a small story focused on correctness of seed data, not complexity
- Total paper trading capital across all portfolios is $400,000

## Dependencies
- Depends on: story-001-001 (portfolios table must exist)
- Blocks: none directly (downstream epics read portfolios at runtime)
