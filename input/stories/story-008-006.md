# Story: Implement Evidence Drill-Down Modal

## Description
Build the evidence drill-down modal that opens when a user clicks on a signal card. Displays a two-column or expandable layout with original comment text on one side and AI annotations on the other. Annotations include sentiment badge, sarcasm flag, reasoning indicator, and confidence score. A "Show Reasoning Summary" section is expandable/collapsible. Comments are paginated via GET /signals/{id}/comments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Clicking a signal card opens a modal overlay displaying evidence for that signal
- [ ] Modal shows the signal header: ticker, direction, overall confidence, signal type, and date
- [ ] Each comment is displayed with original text alongside AI annotations: sentiment badge (bullish/bearish/neutral), sarcasm flag (true/false indicator), reasoning indicator, and confidence score
- [ ] Author trust score is displayed per comment (from author_trust_score field)
- [ ] "Show Reasoning Summary" is an expand/collapse toggle that reveals the AI reasoning summary text
- [ ] Comments are paginated: initial load shows first page, "Load More" button fetches additional pages via GET /signals/{id}/comments with offset
- [ ] Modal can be closed via close button, escape key, or clicking outside the modal

## Technical Notes
- GET /signals/{id}/comments returns comments with AI annotations via the signal_comments junction table
- Each comment includes: comment text, author name, author_trust_score, sentiment, sarcasm_flag, reasoning_text, ai_confidence, ticker_sentiments
- Pagination: use offset-based pagination matching the standard API pattern (limit=20 per page)
- Two-column layout on wide screens (comment left, annotations right); stack vertically on narrower viewports
- Use bootstrap-vue-next `<b-modal>` component for the modal
- Reasoning summary is a separate field on the signal object (not per-comment)
- FR-007: Original comment text must always be visible (not hidden behind a toggle)

## Dependencies
- Depends on: story-008-003 (signal cards are the click target that opens the modal)
- Blocks: story-008-015 (prediction tracking view is accessible from the evidence modal)
