# Story: Scaffold Vue App and Routing

## Description
Set up the Vue 3 application with Composition API, configure Vue Router for the 4 portfolio tabs, and integrate Bootstrap via bootstrap-vue-next. The app is desktop-optimized with no authentication, no localStorage, no Vuex/Pinia, and always resets to Stock/Quality on page reload.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Vue 3 project is scaffolded with Vite and Composition API (no Options API)
- [ ] Vue Router is configured with routes for 4 portfolio views: Stock/Quality (default), Stock/Consensus, Options/Quality, Options/Consensus
- [ ] Bootstrap is integrated via bootstrap-vue-next with default theme applied to the layout shell
- [ ] Application renders a header with navigation and a router-view content area
- [ ] Page reload always navigates to Stock/Quality (default route), with no state persistence
- [ ] No localStorage, sessionStorage, Vuex, or Pinia is used anywhere in the scaffold
- [ ] Application runs on local dev server (e.g., `npm run dev`) and proxies API requests to the FastAPI backend

## Technical Notes
- Depends on epic-007 Phase 7a (GET endpoints available with seed data) for integration, but scaffold can begin independently
- Use `createRouter` with `createWebHistory` for clean URLs
- Vite proxy config: `/api` -> `http://localhost:8000` (FastAPI backend)
- Desktop-optimized: minimum viewport width assumption of 1280px, no responsive breakpoints needed
- NFR-010: Single-user design, no auth middleware or login flow
- Project structure: `src/views/`, `src/components/`, `src/composables/`, `src/api/`
- Axios or native fetch for API calls -- establish pattern here for all subsequent stories

## Dependencies
- Depends on: epic-007 Phase 7a (GET endpoints for integration testing)
- Blocks: story-008-002 (tabs and sub-tabs build on this scaffold)
